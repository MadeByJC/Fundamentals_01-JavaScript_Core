Command-Line Data Processor

What is it?
A logic-only system that simulates real-world data processing.


Project Description
Build a program that: 
- Accepts raw input data (hardcoded or JSON)
- Validates entries
- Cleans malformed values
- Filters unwanted data
- Transforms data into a useful structure
- Outputs a summary

Example Scenario (you choose one)
- User activity logs
- Product inventory data
- Survey responses
- Transaction records

Required Features
- Use functions for every step
- Avoid mutation unless intentional
- Handle edge cases
- Log intermediate steps for clarity
- Produce a final structured output

You must be able to explain:
- Why you structured it this way
- Where mutation happens (and why)
- How data flows from start to end
- What would break if input changes

README Reflection Questions (mandatory)
- What was hardest?
- What concept clicked late?
- What bug taught you the most?
- How would you improve this system?
