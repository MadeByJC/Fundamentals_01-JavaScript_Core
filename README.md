# Fundamentals I – JavaScript Core

## Purpose
This fundamentals pack focuses on building a deep, intuitive understanding of JavaScript at its core.
The goal is not to memorize syntax, but to understand how JavaScript behaves, why it behaves that way,
and how to reason through logic problems without relying on frameworks or external tools.

---

## Rule
No DOM. No frameworks. No libraries. Just JavaScript.

---

## What This Pack Covers
- Variables and primitive types
- Control flow and conditionals
- Loops and iteration
- Functions and scope
- Arrays and objects
- Basic algorithmic thinking

---

## How I Approach Each Challenge
For every challenge in this pack, I follow the same intentional process:

1. Clearly restate the problem in my own words
2. Write a plan before touching code
3. Implement a working solution from scratch
4. Refactor or optimize when appropriate
5. Reflect on what I learned and how this applies to real projects

---

## Why This Matters
Every higher-level concept in web development builds on these fundamentals.
If I can reason through JavaScript logic confidently, I can adapt to any framework or environment later.

---

## Capstone
The capstone for this pack applies all concepts together in a single logic-driven project,
without using the DOM or frameworks.

---

## Reflection
This pack helped me slow down, think before coding, and build confidence in my ability
to solve problems using JavaScript alone.
