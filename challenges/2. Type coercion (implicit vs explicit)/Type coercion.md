Challenge: Coercion Prediction Table

Problem:
Build a script that: Evaluates multiple expressions, Logs the result, Logs why JavaScript produced that result

Example expressions: "5" + 3, "5" - 3, true + false, null == undefined, null === undefined

Hard rule: You must predict the output before running the code.

You must be able to explain:

Loose vs strict equality

When JS coerces types automatically

Why implicit coercion is dangerous and useful
